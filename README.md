# TOPIC: Population Genetics and Comparative Genomics
A repository for the lessons and tutorials for the Population Genetics and Comparative Genomics TOPIC channel of the [BVCN](https://biovcnet.github.io/)


## Prerequisites
* [A working Unix environment](https://github.com/biovcnet/biovcnet.github.io/wiki/1.-Setting-up-a-local-Linux-(or-Unix)-environment)
* [Experience with the command line](https://github.com/biovcnet/biovcnet.github.io/wiki/2.-Using-the-Command-line)

# Overview
This BVCN topic will cover:

* An overview of transcriptomics and metatranscriptomics
* Lessons covering various applications, including:
    * Wetlab and _in silico_ rRNA depletion
    * Recovery/removal of rRNA from metatranscriptomic data

# Lessons
